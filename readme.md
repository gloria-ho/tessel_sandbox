# Tessel Sandbox

Code for the Tessel 2 from the Tessel Workshop: **Building an Extensible IoT Dashboard with Glitch, Azure IoT Hub, and Tessel** on May 16, 2018 @ Microsoft Reactor NYC with **[Suz Hinton](https://twitter.com/noopkat)** and **[Nick Hehr](https://twitter.com/hipsterbrown)**.

The Tessel 2 is an open-source hardware and software platform that can be programmed with JavaScript out of the box! Johnny-Five is a JavaScript robotics and IoT library, like jQuery for hardware. Bringing those 2 pieces together is one of the greatest ways to start building your very first electronics project!

Using a custom Tessel 2 kit we have put together, workshop attendees will go from blinking an LED to building a web-connected service for monitoring a sensor of their choosing. The monitoring solution is an engaging and easy to use web application written in NodeJS and JavaScript that lives on Glitch.com for easy remixing! Customization of the monitoring dashboard is possible to build the IoT app of your dreams.

Attendees will gain knowledge about hardware prototyping, messaging broker services, and controlling their devices from a webpage.
